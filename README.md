# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Big Social Media Data using Apache Spark and Scala

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on large-scale sentiment analysis on user-generated text data from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Yelp). We utilize **Apache Spark** with **Scala** to perform distributed processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Efficient processing of large-scale text data using Apache Spark (RDD, DataFrame, Spark SQL)
- Text cleaning, feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
- Train and evaluate ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
- Use Spark NLP for preprocessing
- Analyze performance and scalability of distributed computing
